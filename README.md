## Overview  
This project implements a simple Python-based customer banking system. It allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts over a specified number of months. Users can input their account information, and the system will return the interest earned and the updated account balance.

## Project Details  
The system is designed to simulate a basic banking system that calculates interest on both savings and CD (Certificate of Deposit) accounts. Users are asked to input the balance, annual percentage rate (APR), and the number of months for each account. The system then calculates the interest earned and displays the updated balance.

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
3. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code or any preferred IDE.
4. This project does not require any additional Python packages.

## Usage  
1. Run the `customer_banking.py` script.
2. Follow the prompts to input your savings account and CD account details.
3. The program will calculate the interest earned and display the updated balances for both accounts.

### Running the Script
- **Visual Studio Code:** Open the script in VS Code, ensure the correct Python interpreter is selected, and run the script using the integrated terminal or the run button.
- **Command Line:** Navigate to the project directory in the terminal and execute the script using `python customer_banking.py`.

## Features  
- Calculates interest for both savings and CD accounts.
- Input validation to ensure correct data types.
- Returns updated balances and interest earned for a specified number of months.
